Work in progress. Amsterdam Light Festival entry concept work by [Harish Persad](http://harishpersad.tumblr.com/) and [Sam Twidale](http://samcodes.co.uk/code/).

Interact with the WebGL demo [in your browser](https://tw1ddle.github.io/Amsterdam-Light-Show-2016/). The theme is [biomimetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics). Tested in Google Chrome.

## Features ##
* Shaders operating on a webcam feed to produce disruptive patterns.
* Basic controls for tweaking the demo.
* ~~Automatically adapt to feed luminance.~~
* ~~Webcam feed denoising shaders.~~
* ~~More plans abound...~~

## Notes ##
* The distance field shaders are based on the public domain implementation by [Stefan Gustavson](http://openglinsights.com/).
* This project was inspired by [Dazzle painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage) and [patterns in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature).
* Written using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) and [three.js](http://threejs.org/).
* Uses actuate and Sure from [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/).
