## Notes ##
* The distance field shaders are based on the public domain implementation by [Stefan Gustavson](http://openglinsights.com/).
* This project is influenced by [Dazzle painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage) and [patterns in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature).
* Written using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) and [three.js](http://threejs.org/).
* Uses actuate and Sure from [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/).
